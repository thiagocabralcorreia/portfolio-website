# PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my portfolio project! üëã

As a developer, I believe that a portfolio is not only a showcase of my work, but also an opportunity to create a great user experience.

To achieve this goal, I used React.js, TypeScript and incorporated Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. I also used Framer Motion to add engaging animations and React Scroll for smooth scrolling between sections.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating it. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just to say hello!
